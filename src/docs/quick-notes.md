Topics to cover: what Quick Notes is and when to use it, how to open Quick Notes quickly, typing a word vs. recording audio, how recorded audio is stored (on-device only, synced via iCloud), converting a Quick Note into a full flashcard with AI Lookup, managing and clearing your Quick Notes queue, and microphone permission requirements.</p>
