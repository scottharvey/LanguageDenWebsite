# Quick Notes

<p class="docs-subtitle">
  Capture words on the fly — from a TV show, a conversation, a book — and turn them into flashcards later.

## What Are Quick Notes?

Quick Notes is a lightweight capture tool for words you encounter in the wild. When you hear an unfamiliar word in a TV show or read one in a book, you don't want to break your flow to open the full Add Word screen — Quick Notes lets you jot it down in seconds and process it into a proper flashcard later.

## Capturing a Note

Open Quick Notes from the Home tab. You can capture a word in two ways:

### Text mode

Type the word (or a short phrase) into the text field and tap **Save**. The note is stored instantly.

### Audio mode (iOS)

Tap the microphone button to switch to audio mode. Press the large record button and speak the word. Language Den records the audio and transcribes it automatically. You can choose which language to record in — your target language or your native language — using the language selector that appears before recording.

The recorded audio is stored alongside the transcript so you can play it back when processing the note later.

  <p>Microphone access is required for audio capture. Language Den will prompt you for permission the first time you switch to audio mode. Audio data is stored on-device and synced via iCloud — it is never sent to any server.</p>

## Processing Notes into Words

Quick Notes are organised into three tabs: **Pending**, **All**, and **Processed**.

To turn a note into a full word:

1. Tap the note in the **Pending** tab
2. Language Den opens the [Add Word](/docs/adding-words/) screen with the text pre-filled
3. Complete the word entry (with or without AI assistance) and tap **Save**
4. The note is automatically marked as **Processed** and moves out of the pending queue

## Managing Your Notes

- Swipe left on a note to delete it
- Use the **All** tab to see every note regardless of processing status
- Use the **Processed** tab to review notes you've already turned into words

Notes accumulate in the Pending tab until you process or delete them. It's a good habit to clear your pending notes at the start or end of each study session.
