  <p>This page hasn't been written yet. Topics to cover: what spaced repetition is, how the FSRS algorithm works, how intervals are calculated, how ratings (Again / Hard / Good / Easy) affect scheduling, how the algorithm adapts to individual memory patterns, and how it compares to older algorithms like SM-2.</p>
