  <div class="docs-callout-title">TODO</div>
  <p>This page hasn't been written yet. Topics to cover: where data is stored (on-device + iCloud only, never on Language Den servers), what is sent to third-party APIs (words sent to AI provider for lookups, images fetched from Unsplash), what is never collected (no analytics, no tracking SDKs, no usage logs), iCloud data management (how to view and delete Language Den data in iOS Settings → Apple Account → iCloud), on-device audio from Quick Notes, microphone and photo library permission explanations, and how to fully delete all your data. Link to the full Privacy Policy.</p>
