  Language Den works with any language you can type. This page covers the full list of supported languages and any language-specific features.

  <div class="docs-callout-title">TODO</div>
  <p>This page hasn't been written yet. Topics to cover: the full list of 55+ supported languages, the difference between "any typeable language" support and languages with dedicated AI support, input method guidance per script (Latin, CJK with IME, Arabic RTL, Devanagari, etc.), language-specific features (furigana for Japanese, pinyin/zhuyin for Chinese, romanisation for non-Latin scripts), and how to switch between multiple target languages.</p>
