## Changing Your Language

Go to **Settings → Languages** to change your target language (the language you're learning) or your native language (used for translations). You can change these at any time — your existing vocabulary is not affected.

---

## Right-to-Left Script Support

The following languages use right-to-left scripts and receive automatic RTL layout in word input fields:

- **Arabic**
- **Hebrew**
- **Persian (Farsi)**
- **Urdu**

Text fields automatically align right when one of these is selected as your target language.

## Input Methods

Language Den uses the standard iOS keyboard for all text input. For languages with complex scripts, use the relevant iOS input method:

| Script | Input method |
|--------|-------------|
| Latin (Spanish, French, German, etc.) | Standard keyboard |
| Chinese (Mandarin) | iOS Pinyin or Handwriting IME |
| Japanese | iOS Kana or Romaji IME |
| Korean | iOS Korean keyboard |
| Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Persian | iOS RTL keyboard |
| Devanagari (Hindi, Nepali, Marathi) | iOS Devanagari keyboard |
| Thai | iOS Thai keyboard |

## Custom Metadata Fields

For non-Latin scripts, it's useful to store a romanisation alongside the word (e.g. rōmaji for Japanese, pinyin for Chinese, romanisation for Thai). You can configure custom metadata fields in **Settings → Languages → Metadata Fields**. Fields you add here appear automatically on the add-word form and on each word's detail screen.

## AI Language Support

The AI features (word analysis, flashcard generation) work with all 59 languages, but quality varies by language. Languages with larger training data — such as Spanish, French, Japanese, Chinese, and German — generally produce better results than lower-resource languages.
