  <p>This page hasn't been written yet. Topics to cover: why images help with vocabulary retention (picture superiority effect), how to search for images with the built-in Unsplash integration, how to add a photo from your camera roll, how images appear during study sessions, local caching behaviour, privacy implications (only selected images are saved; full photo library is not scanned), and how to remove or replace an image.</p>
