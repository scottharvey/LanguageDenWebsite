  Track your learning progress, review consistency, and vocabulary mastery all from the Home tab.

## Summary Stats

Four headline metrics appear at the top of the Home tab:

| Stat | What it measures |
|------|-----------------|
| **Day Streak** | Consecutive days on which you completed at least one review |
| **Words Learned** | Total words you've reviewed at least once (moved out of New state) |
| **Reviewed Today** | Unique words reviewed in the last 24 hours |
| **Accuracy** | Percentage of Good + Easy ratings out of your last 100 reviews |

---

## Weekly Progress

A 7-day bar chart shows how many unique words you reviewed on each day of the past week. Today's bar is highlighted. The total for the week is shown above the chart.

Use this to spot gaps in your review habit and to confirm you're keeping up with your due cards.

## Mastery Breakdown

A stacked progress bar shows the distribution of your vocabulary across three states:

- **Mastered** — words in the Review state with a stability ≥ 90 days. These are words you know very well and will only need reviewing a few times a year.
- **Learning** — words you've started reviewing but haven't yet reached long-term stability.
- **New** — words added to your collection but not yet reviewed.

Word counts and percentages are shown for each category.

## Struggling Words

The **Struggling Words** card lists up to 10 words that are giving you the most trouble, ranked by a combination of how many times you've pressed **Again** and the word's current difficulty score. Each word shows its lapse count.

Tap **Practice these words** to start a targeted review session focused only on those words — useful for giving extra attention to persistent trouble spots without waiting for them to come up naturally in your regular queue.
