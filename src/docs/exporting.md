<p class="docs-subtitle">
  Export your word lists and progress data from Language Den for backup or use in other apps.

  <div class="docs-callout-title">TODO</div>
  <p>This page hasn't been written yet. Topics to cover: exporting a single list as a CSV (what fields are included, where the file is saved), exporting all data as a ZIP archive (contents of the archive, what metadata is included), how to access export options from the list detail view and from Settings → Import / Export, using exported data as a backup before deleting the app or account, and opening exported files in Numbers, Excel, or other tools.</p>
