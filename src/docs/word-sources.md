# Word Sources

<p class="docs-subtitle">
  Organise your vocabulary by where you encountered it — a book, a TV series, a podcast, or any other source — and study words in context.

## What Are Word Sources?

A Word Source is an optional container that groups vocabulary by its real-world origin. If you're learning words from a novel, you can create a source called *The Little Prince* and track which chapter each word came from. If you're watching a TV series, you can create a source for the show and add a section per episode.

Sources are entirely optional — words don't have to belong to one. But they're useful for learners who want to connect vocabulary back to the material they're consuming.

## Source Types

When creating a source, choose from six types:

| Type | Icon | Use case |
|------|------|----------|
| Book | Book | Novels, textbooks, graded readers |
| TV Series | TV | Shows, dramas, anime |
| Podcast | Microphone | Audio content, language learning podcasts |
| Newspaper | Newspaper | Articles, news sites |
| Article | Document | Blog posts, online reading |
| Other | — | Anything else |

## Sections

Each source can have one or more **sections** — subdivisions that correspond to chapters, episodes, or any other unit. For example:

- *Harry Potter* → Chapter 1, Chapter 2, …
- *My Favourite Drama* → Episode 1, Episode 2, …

Words are linked to a section (not directly to a source), so you always know exactly where each word came from.

## Creating a Source

1. Go to the **Sources** tab
2. Tap **Add New Source**
3. Enter a name and choose a source type
4. Tap **Save**

Then open the source and tap **Add Section** to create your first section.

## Adding Words to a Source

When adding a word via [Add Word](/docs/adding-words/), a **Source** picker appears at the bottom of the form (if you have at least one source set up). Select the section where you encountered the word.

When importing via [CSV](/docs/csv/) or [Anki](/docs/anki/), you can assign all imported words to a source section in the import preview screen.

## Reviewing by Source

Open a source or section and tap **Review** to start a review session that includes only words from that source. This is useful for studying vocabulary from a specific chapter before moving on.
