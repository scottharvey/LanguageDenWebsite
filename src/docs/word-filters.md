# Word Filters

<p class="docs-subtitle">
  Find and manage specific words in your collection using filters and search.
</p>

---

## The Words Tab

The **Words** tab shows your full vocabulary list. At the top, a row of filter chips lets you narrow the list, and a search bar lets you find words by text or translation.

---

## Filter Chips

Four filters are available, each showing a count of matching words:

| Filter | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| **All** | Every word in your collection |
| **Flagged** | Words you've manually flagged for attention |
| **Suspended** | Words temporarily excluded from review sessions |
| **No Flashcards** | Accepted words that have no flashcards yet |

Tap a chip to switch to that filter. Only one filter is active at a time.

---

## Search

The search bar filters the current word list by matching against the word text and its translation. Search and filter work together — for example, you can search within the Flagged list.

---

## Flagging Words

Tap a word to open its detail screen, then tap the **flag icon** to flag it. Flagged words are highlighted and easy to find with the Flagged filter. Use flags to mark words you want to revisit, words with tricky pronunciation, or any word you want to give extra attention.

---

## Suspending Words

Suspending a word removes it from review sessions without deleting it. The word stays in your collection with its review history intact, but it won't appear in your queue until you unsuspend it.

To suspend a word, open its detail screen and tap the **Suspend** option in the menu. To unsuspend, tap the same option again or find it via the Suspended filter.

Suspension is useful for words that are seasonally irrelevant (e.g. holiday vocabulary) or words you're temporarily setting aside while you focus on other material.

## Bulk Actions

From the Words tab menu (top-right), you can:

- **Generate Flashcards for All** — queues AI flashcard generation for all words that don't yet have flashcards
- **Delete** words in bulk by selecting them with a long press
