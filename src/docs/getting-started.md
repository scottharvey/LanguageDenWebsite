# Getting Started

<p class="docs-subtitle">
  Get up and running with Language Den in under five minutes. This guide covers installation, your first word list, and your first study session.
</p>

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An iPhone or iPad running **iOS 16.0** or later
- An active internet connection for AI features
- Approximately 45 MB of free storage

---

## Step 1: Install the App

Download Language Den from the App Store. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Once installed, open the app and follow the brief onboarding flow.

  <p>If you already have a Language Den account from a previous device, sign in during onboarding to restore all your word lists and progress automatically.</p>
</div>

## Step 2: Choose a Language

On first launch, Language Den will ask you to select a **target language** — the language you want to learn — and your **native language** for translations.

You can change these at any time from **Settings → Languages**. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Supported input methods vary by language:

- **Latin-script languages** — keyboard input
- **Japanese / Chinese** — keyboard input with system IME
- **Arabic** — right-to-left keyboard input

## Step 3: Create Your First Word List

Word lists are the core organisational unit in Language Den. To create one:

1. Tap the **+** button on the Home tab
2. Give your list a name (e.g. *Travel Vocabulary*)
3. Optionally add a description or colour tag
4. Tap **Create**

Your new list will appear on the Home tab ready for words to be added.

### Adding Words

Once inside a list, tap **Add Word** to add your first entry. You can type the word manually or use the **AI Lookup** button to auto-fill the definition, example sentence, and pronunciation.

<div class="docs-callout docs-callout--info">
  <div class="docs-callout-title">Info</div>
  <p>AI Lookup uses your device's internet connection. Results are cached locally after the first lookup, so subsequent reviews work offline.</p>
</div>

## Step 4: Start a Study Session

When you're ready to study, tap **Study** from the list detail view. Language Den will generate a session based on:

- Words you haven't seen yet (new)
- Words due for review based on spaced repetition
- Words you previously marked as difficult

A typical session contains **10–20 items** by default. You can adjust this in **Settings → Study Sessions**.

## Spaced Repetition Overview

Language Den uses a spaced repetition system (SRS) to schedule reviews. After each word, you rate how well you remembered it:

| Rating | Meaning | Next Review |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Again | Didn't remember | ~10 minutes |
| Hard | Remembered with effort | ~1 day |
| Good | Remembered easily | ~3 days |
| Easy | Instantly recalled | ~7 days |

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Intervals grow exponentially with each successful review, so words you know well are shown less frequently over time.

## Next Steps

Now that you've completed your first session, explore these topics:

- [Vocabulary Management](/docs/vocabulary/) — Import words in bulk, add images, and organise with tags
- [AI Features](/docs/ai-features/) — Auto-generate definitions, example sentences, and audio
- [Settings & Preferences](/docs/settings/) — Tune the SRS algorithm, notification schedule, and app appearance

  <p>Deleting a word list is permanent and cannot be undone. All progress data for words in that list will be lost. Export your list first if you want to keep a backup.</p>
