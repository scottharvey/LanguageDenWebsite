  <p>This page hasn't been written yet. Topics to cover: iCloud sync not working (checking iCloud Drive is enabled, resolving sync conflicts), AI Lookup returning errors or poor results (network requirements, rate limits, clearing cache), audio pronunciation not playing, words not appearing in review sessions (understanding "buried" cards, checking session limits), CSV import failures (encoding issues, missing columns), resetting the app without losing data, and how to contact support.</p>
