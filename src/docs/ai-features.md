# AI Features

<p class="docs-subtitle">
  Language Den uses on-device and cloud AI to generate definitions, example sentences, pronunciation guides, and more — saving you hours of manual entry.
</p>

## Overview

AI features in Language Den are powered by a combination of on-device processing and cloud models. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Most AI lookups complete in under two seconds. Results are cached locally so that subsequent reviews of the same word work fully offline.

<div class="docs-callout docs-callout--info">
  <div class="docs-callout-title">Privacy</div>
  <p>Words you look up are sent to our AI provider solely to generate definitions and examples. They are not stored, logged, or used to train any model. See our <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>
</div>

## AI Lookup

**AI Lookup** is the quickest way to populate a new word entry. When you type a word and tap the AI Lookup button, Language Den automatically generates:

- **Definition** — A concise translation and meaning in your native language
- **Example sentence** — A natural, contextually appropriate example
- **Pronunciation** — A phonetic guide or romanisation appropriate for the language
- **Part of speech** — Noun, verb, adjective, etc.

### How to Use It

1. Open a list and tap **Add Word**
2. Type the word or phrase in the **Word** field
3. Tap the **✨ AI Lookup** button
4. Review the generated content and edit anything you want to change
5. Tap **Save**

All generated fields are fully editable before saving. Nothing is locked in — you're always in control of the final content.

## Example Sentence Generation

You can generate additional example sentences for any existing word. This is useful when you want more exposure to how a word is used in different contexts.

To generate new examples:

1. Open a word entry
2. Tap **More Examples**
3. Choose how many examples to generate (1–5)
4. Tap **Generate**

Examples are generated with a focus on natural, everyday usage rather than overly formal or textbook-style sentences.

### Adjusting Difficulty

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. You can request examples at a specific difficulty level:

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| Beginner | Short sentences with common vocabulary |
| Intermediate | Natural everyday speech; some idioms |
| Advanced | Complex grammar; nuanced vocabulary |
| Native | Authentic prose, news, or literary style |

Difficulty can be set globally in **Settings → AI → Example Difficulty**, or per-word using the level picker in the word editor.

## Audio Pronunciation

Language Den can generate audio pronunciation for any word using text-to-speech. Tap the **speaker icon** next to a word to hear it spoken aloud.

```
Settings → AI → Pronunciation Voice
```

Available voice options include:

- **System (default)** — Uses the iOS system TTS voice for the target language
- **Natural** — An AI-generated voice for more lifelike pronunciation
- **Slow** — Reduced speed for easier comprehension

<div class="docs-callout">
  <div class="docs-callout-title">Tip</div>
  <p>For tonal languages like Mandarin and Cantonese, the Natural voice more accurately represents pitch changes than the System voice. We recommend switching if you're studying one of these languages.</p>

## Smart Review Hints

During a study session, if you're struggling with a word, you can tap **Show Hint** to reveal an AI-generated memory aid. These hints are generated on the fly and tailored to the specific word, often including:

- An etymology note
- A visual analogy
- A mnemonic linking the sound to a familiar word in your native language

<div class="docs-callout docs-callout--warning">
  <div class="docs-callout-title">Warning</div>
  <p>AI-generated hints and definitions can occasionally contain errors, especially for uncommon words or highly colloquial phrases. Always verify important content against a trusted dictionary or native speaker.</p>
</div>

## Conversation Practice (Beta)

The **Conversation Practice** feature lets you have a text-based conversation with an AI tutor in your target language. The tutor adapts to your level and gently corrects errors inline.

To start a conversation:

1. Go to the **Practice** tab
2. Select **Conversation**
3. Choose a scenario (e.g. *Ordering at a café*, *Job interview*, *Making plans with friends*)
4. Start chatting

Conversation Practice is currently in **beta**. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. You can enable it in **Settings → Beta Features → Conversation Practice**.
