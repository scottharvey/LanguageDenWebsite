## Step 1: Export Your Deck from Anki

2. Click the gear icon next to your deck → **Export**
3. Choose **Anki Deck Package (.apkg)**
4. Save to a location you'll remember

## Step 2: Import into Language Den

1. Open Language Den on your iPhone
2. Tap **Import** on the main screen
3. Select your .apkg file from Files or iCloud Drive

The app automatically detects your deck structure and prepares for import.

## Step 3: Map Your Fields

Language Den shows you a preview of your cards. For most decks:

- **Front field** → Word
- **Back field** → Translation

Tap **Import** and you're done. Your cards are ready to review.

## Start Reviewing

That's it. Your vocabulary is now in Language Den with the modern FSRS algorithm optimizing your review schedule.

The first review might feel different—that's the improved spacing algorithm at work. Give it a week and you'll notice you're remembering more with less effort.
