The Anki community has spent over 20 years building vocabulary decks for every language imaginable. Core frequency lists. TV show vocab. Medical terminology. Business Japanese. There are decks for learners at every level, covering every interest.

You don't need to use Anki to benefit from all that work. Language Den can import any Anki deck directly, so you can take advantage of the best community-built content and study it the way you actually want to.

## Where to find Anki decks

The best place to start is [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks), where thousands of decks are shared for free. You can search by language, topic, or skill level. Some highlights worth knowing about:

- **Frequency decks**: the most common 2,000 words in a language, ranked by how often they appear in real speech
- **Grammar-based decks**: vocabulary organised by structure (verbs, particles, classifiers, etc.)
- **Immersion decks**: words pulled from popular TV shows, books, or films

If you've already been using Anki, you may have decks on your computer that you've collected or built yourself. Those work too.

## How to get a deck into Language Den

The process takes less than a minute:

1. **Download or export the deck**: on AnkiWeb, hit the download button to get an `.apkg` file. If you're exporting from the Anki desktop app, go to File > Export and choose Anki Deck Package.

2. **Send the file to your device**: AirDrop, iCloud Drive, email, or any file transfer method works.

3. **Open the file in Language Den**: tap the `.apkg` file and Language Den will open the importer automatically. It reads your deck and figures out which fields contain your words, translations, and audio.

4. **Confirm and import**: for most standard decks, everything is pre-mapped correctly. Hit import and you're done.

## What gets imported

Language Den pulls in everything that matters for studying:

- Words and translations
- Audio pronunciations (if the deck includes them)
- Images
- Any extra fields you want to keep as context

## Starting fresh

One thing worth knowing: this is a fresh start. Language Den imports the vocabulary content from a deck, not your review history or progress from Anki. Think of it as loading up a great word list and beginning your study from day one, with Language Den's review engine driving things from there.

For most people, that's a feature rather than a limitation. You're not trying to replicate what you did in Anki. You're taking proven content and studying it in a way that fits how you actually learn.

## Start exploring

If you're learning a new language and not sure where to begin, browsing AnkiWeb is a genuinely good use of 10 minutes. Pick a frequency deck for your target language, import it, and you'll have a solid vocabulary foundation ready to go.

Language Den handles the scheduling and review from there.
