Language Den uses something called FSRS for spaced repetition. If you're wondering what that means and why you should care, here's the simple explanation.

## The problem with one-size-fits-all

Most flashcard apps use the same review schedule for everyone. Review a card after 1 day, then 3 days, then a week, and so on. This works okay, but it's like wearing someone else's shoes — close enough, but not quite right.

The reality? We all forget at different rates. Some people might remember "bonjour" for weeks after seeing it once. Others need to review it every few days. Traditional spaced repetition doesn't account for this.

## Enter FSRS: Reviews that adapt to you

FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) is different. It learns how YOU forget.

Every time you review a card and rate how well you remembered it, FSRS adjusts its understanding of your memory patterns. After a few reviews, it knows:

- Which types of words stick easily for you
- Which ones you struggle with
- How quickly you typically forget new vocabulary

The result? Your reviews are personalized. The app shows you words right before you'd forget them — not too early (wasting time) and not too late (having to relearn).

## What this means in practice

Let's say you're learning 1000 Spanish words:

**Traditional spacing:** ~50-60 reviews per day, every day
**FSRS in Language Den:** ~30-40 reviews per day

That's 30-40% less time spent reviewing, with better retention. Those extra 20-30 daily reviews? That's time you can spend learning new words instead of over-reviewing ones you already know.

## Why this matters

When you're learning a language, efficiency compounds. Spending less time on reviews means:

- More time for new vocabulary
- Less burnout from endless flashcards
- Better long-term retention
- Actually enjoying the process

## The Language Den approach

We chose FSRS because it aligns with our philosophy: use the best available science to help people learn efficiently. It's open source (like Language Den will be), it's based on real memory research, and most importantly — it works.

You don't need to understand the algorithm. You just need to add words and review them when Language Den suggests. The app handles the complexity so you can focus on what matters: building your vocabulary.
