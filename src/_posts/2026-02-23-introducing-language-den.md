Today we're launching Language Den — a vocabulary learning app for iOS built around one idea: the best way to remember words is to review them at exactly the right moment.

## Why we built it

Most vocabulary tools fall into two camps. Flashcard apps like Anki are powerful but require a lot of manual setup. Apps like Duolingo and Quizlet are easy to pick up but don't give you the control to learn the specific words you actually care about.

Language Den is our attempt to thread that needle — spaced repetition and a serious review engine, with the friction of getting started removed as much as possible.

## What's in the first release

**Spaced repetition built in.** Every word you add gets scheduled automatically. Language Den surfaces cards when you're most likely to forget them, so your review time stays short even as your vocabulary grows.

**AI-powered flashcard generation.** Add a word and Language Den can generate a definition, example sentence, and image automatically. No copying and pasting from dictionaries.

**Anki import.** If you already have decks in Anki, you can bring them straight in. Your existing work doesn't go to waste.

**iCloud sync.** Your words stay in sync across your iPhone and iPad automatically.

**Quick Notes.** Capture words on the go without interrupting what you're doing. Come back later to turn them into full flashcards.

## What's next

This is the first release, so there's plenty more to come — more flashcard types, better statistics, and support for more languages. We'll share updates here as they ship.

If you try Language Den and have feedback, we'd love to hear it at [hey@languageden.com](mailto:hey@languageden.com).
