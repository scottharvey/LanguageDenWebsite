## Article Proposal

**Content Pillar:** Memory & Retention Science  
**Target Keywords:** spaced repetition, forgetting curve, memory science  
**Why now:** Foundation article - establishes our scientific credibility before product-specific content  
**Impact:** High - educates while positioning Language Den as memory-first  

## Proposed Angle

This article would explain the science of forgetting in an accessible way, then show how spaced repetition (specifically modern algorithms like FSRS) solves this problem. We'd position Language Den as built on this scientific foundation without being salesy.

## Detailed Outline

### 1. The Universal Experience
- Start with relatable scenario: studying a word on Monday, blank stare by Friday
- "Your brain isn't broken. It's doing exactly what it evolved to do."

### 2. The Forgetting Curve (Ebbinghaus)
- Simple explanation with everyday analogies
- Why forgetting is actually useful (brain efficiency)
- The exponential decay of memory

### 3. How Spaced Repetition Interrupts Forgetting
- Review at the moment before forgetting
- Each successful recall strengthens the memory
- The intervals get longer as memory stabilizes

### 4. Why Timing Is Everything
- Too early = wasted effort
- Too late = starting over
- The sweet spot: 90% retention probability

### 5. Modern Algorithms Make It Personal
- Original algorithms used fixed schedules
- FSRS adapts to YOUR memory patterns
- Brief mention of Language Den using FSRS (not pushy)

### 6. Practical Takeaways
- Why cramming fails for language learning
- How to know if your tool uses real spaced repetition
- What to look for in a vocabulary app

## SEO Notes
- Target featured snippet for "what is spaced repetition"
- Include semantic keywords: memory retention, vocabulary learning, forgetting curve
- Internal link opportunities: future FSRS deep-dive, Anki comparison

## Tone Notes
- Educational, not promotional
- "We noticed..." rather than "Our app does..."
- Build authority first, mention product naturally
