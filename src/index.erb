      <h2 class="longform-heading">Let's be honest. You've tried other apps. They didn't work.</h2>
      <p class="longform-body">You downloaded Duolingo. You kept the streak going for a while. But then you realized you were spending 20 minutes a day matching pictures to words you already knew. You weren't learning. You were playing a game.</p>
      <p class="longform-body">Maybe you tried Anki. People on Reddit swear by it. So you downloaded it, opened it up, and... stared at a screen that looks like it was designed in 2006. Because it was. You tried to make a card. Then you had to learn about "note types" and "card templates" and "deck options." You just wanted to learn some vocabulary.</p>
      <p class="longform-body">Or maybe Quizlet. Clean interface. Easy to use. You made some flashcards, studied them, felt great. Two weeks later? Gone. All of it. Because Quizlet has no spaced repetition. It's a tool for cramming before an exam, not for actually learning a language.</p>
      <p class="longform-body">Sound familiar?</p>
      <p class="longform-body"><strong>The problem isn't you. The problem is that none of these tools were built for what you're actually trying to do.</strong></p>

      <p class="longform-body">Hours configuring Anki decks instead of actually studying. Days maintaining a Duolingo streak that taught you nothing useful. Weeks re-learning the same words on Quizlet because they never stuck in the first place.</p>
      <p class="longform-body">And here's the worst part: you <em>know</em> how you should be learning vocabulary. You know spaced repetition works. You know flashcards are effective. You just haven't found an app that does it right for language learning.</p>

      <p class="longform-body">Language Den is a vocabulary app built exclusively for language learners. Not a generic flashcard tool that you have to bend into shape. Not a game that wastes your time. A focused, purpose-built app for one thing: <strong>helping you learn and remember vocabulary in any language.</strong></p>
      <p class="longform-body">Every feature exists because language learners need it. Nothing exists because a product manager thought it would look good on a feature list.</p>

      <h2 class="longform-heading">Here's what makes Language Den different from everything else</h2>

      <div class="sales-point">
        <h3 class="sales-point-heading">Spaced repetition that actually works (without a manual)</h3>
        <p class="longform-body">Spaced repetition is the single most effective technique for long-term memorization. This isn't debated. It's settled science. The problem is that most apps either don't have it (Quizlet) or make you configure it yourself (Anki).</p>
        <p class="longform-body">Language Den uses FSRS, a modern algorithm that's more accurate than what Anki has used for the past 20 years. It tracks how well you know each word and schedules your reviews at the exact moment you're about to forget.</p>
        <p class="longform-body">You don't configure anything. You don't tweak settings. You don't install add-ons. You just review your cards and the app handles everything else.</p>
        <p class="longform-body"><strong>Result: you remember more words while spending less time studying.</strong></p>

      <div class="section-divider"></div>

      <div class="sales-point">
        <h3 class="sales-point-heading">Any language you can type. Seriously, any.</h3>
        <p class="longform-body">Duolingo supports about 40 languages. Sounds like a lot until you realize yours isn't on the list. Even if it is, you're stuck with their curriculum. You can't learn your own words.</p>
        <p class="longform-body">Anki technically supports everything, but you have to find or build all the content yourself.</p>
        <p class="longform-body">Language Den works with any language you can type. Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Korean, Swahili, Welsh, Tagalog, Uzbek, Navajo, Esperanto. It doesn't matter. There's no fixed list. If you can type it, you can learn it.</p>
        <p class="longform-body"><strong>Learning a less common language? You get the same experience as someone learning Spanish. No compromises.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="sales-point-heading">Built specifically for how languages work</h3>
        <p class="longform-body">Anki doesn't know the difference between a vocabulary card and a geography card. Quizlet doesn't either. They're generic tools.</p>
        <p class="longform-body">Language Den understands that language learning has specific needs. Definitions in context. Natural example sentences. Conjugation patterns. Multiple card types so you can learn the same word from different angles.</p>
        <p class="longform-body"><strong>This is what "built for language learners" actually means. Every feature is designed around how you learn vocabulary, not how you memorize random facts.</strong></p>

        <p class="longform-body">You're watching a show in your target language. Someone says a word you don't know. You think "I should look that up later." You never do. The word is gone forever.</p>
        <p class="longform-body">Language Den's Quick Notes fix this. Hear a new word? Open the app, type it in (or record the audio), and close it. Done. Two seconds. Later, when you have time, process your notes into full flashcards with a single tap.</p>
        <p class="longform-body"><strong>Every word you encounter becomes a word you can learn. Nothing slips through the cracks.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="sales-point-heading">Images that make words stick</h3>
        <p class="longform-body">There's a concept in cognitive science called the "picture superiority effect." Your brain remembers images dramatically better than text. It's not even close.</p>
        <p class="longform-body">Language Den has built-in image search powered by Unsplash. Find a photo that captures the meaning of a word and attach it to your card. When you review, that visual anchor helps cement the word in your memory in a way that text alone never will.</p>

        <h3 class="sales-point-heading">Your data. Your device. Your iCloud. That's it.</h3>
        <p class="longform-body">Most apps want your email, your name, your usage data. They track what you study, when you study, and how you study. Then they sell that data or use it to push you toward a subscription.</p>
        <p class="longform-body">Language Den doesn't do any of that.</p>
        <p class="longform-body">There's no account to create. Your data syncs through your personal iCloud, and it never touches anyone else's servers. Start a review on your iPhone, finish it on your iPad. No ads. No tracking. No analytics SDKs.</p>

    <div class="longform-container longform-container--narrow">
      <h2 class="longform-heading">You might be wondering...</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>"Is it really free? What's the catch?"</h3>
          <p>There is no catch. Language Den is free to download and free to use. No subscription. No paywall. No "premium" features locked behind a monthly fee. The free version will always be free.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>"What's FSRS? Is it better than what Anki uses?"</h3>
          <p>FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) is a modern, open-source scheduling algorithm. It's more accurate than SM-2, which Anki used as its default for over 15 years. FSRS adapts to your personal memory patterns and schedules reviews more efficiently. You don't need to know any of this to use the app. It just works.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>"Does it have AI features?"</h3>
          <p>Yes, as an optional extra. You can connect an OpenRouter API key to auto-generate flashcard content like definitions, example sentences, and conjugations. But the app is fully functional without it. AI is there if you want it. It's not required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>"What if my language isn't supported?"</h3>
          <p>It is. Language Den works with any language you can type. There's no fixed language list. If your keyboard can produce the characters, Language Den can teach you the words.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>"I have years of Anki decks. Can I bring them over?"</h3>
          <p>Yes. Language Den imports .apkg files directly. You can also import from CSV. Your existing work comes with you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>"Do I need to create an account?"</h3>
          <p>No. Language Den uses your existing iCloud (Apple ID) for syncing. There's nothing to sign up for. Open the app and start learning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>"What if I don't like it?"</h3>
          <p>Delete it. It's free. You haven't lost anything. But give it a week of daily reviews first. That's when spaced repetition starts to click, and you'll feel the difference.</p>
