*Last updated: February 2026*

Language Den ("the app", "we", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the app handles, how it is used, and your rights.

## Summary

- Language Den does **not** collect analytics, show ads, or sell your data
- All your learning data (words, flashcards, notes) stays on your device and in your own iCloud account
- No personal information is sent to us
- API keys you add are stored securely in the iOS Keychain, on your device only

## Data Stored on Your Device and in iCloud

Language Den stores your vocabulary data — words, flashcards, review history, and quick notes — using Apple's SwiftData with CloudKit. This means:

- Your data is stored **on your device** and synced through **your personal iCloud account**
- It is protected by your Apple ID and iCloud security settings
- We have no access to your iCloud data

You can delete all data at any time by deleting the app.

## Device Permissions

The app requests these permissions only when you use the corresponding features:

**Microphone**
Used to record audio in Quick Notes. Recordings are stored locally or synced through your iCloud account. Audio is never sent to our servers.

**Speech Recognition**
Used to transcribe spoken notes into text. Transcription is performed on-device using Apple's speech recognition framework.

**Photo Library**
Used to attach images to flashcards. Selected images are stored in your app data within iCloud. We do not access your full photo library.

## Third-Party APIs (Optional)

Language Den supports optional integrations that you configure yourself. These are entirely opt-in.

**OpenRouter API**
If you add an OpenRouter API key, the app sends word data (the word and translation you provide) to the OpenRouter API to generate flashcard content. Your API key is stored in the iOS Keychain on your device and is never sent to us. You are responsible for your usage under [OpenRouter's Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms).

**Unsplash API**
If you add an Unsplash API key, the app sends image search queries to the Unsplash API to find images for flashcards. Your API key is stored in the iOS Keychain on your device and is never sent to us. You are responsible for your usage under [Unsplash's Terms of Service](https://unsplash.com/terms).

These API keys are stored exclusively on your device in the iOS Keychain. We cannot see, access, or recover them.

## Analytics and Advertising

Language Den contains **no analytics**, **no advertising SDKs**, and **no tracking**. We do not use any third-party analytics tools (such as Firebase, Mixpanel, or similar).

---

## Children

Language Den does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app contains no features designed to collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as the app evolves. Significant changes will be noted on this page with an updated date.
