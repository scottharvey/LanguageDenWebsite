Language Den is a one-person project. No team. No investors. No growth hackers. Just one developer who got fed up with the existing options and decided to build something better.

## Hi, I'm Scott

I'm a web and iOS developer based in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I've spent the last 15+ years building software, primarily with Ruby on Rails, with a strong bias toward tools that are productive, well-designed, and actually enjoyable to use.

I built Language Den because I'm a language learner myself, and I kept running into the same wall everyone else does: the apps that exist are either gamified to the point of uselessness, impossibly complex to set up, or just not built with real language acquisition in mind.

I wanted an app that was:

- **Serious about spaced repetition** — not a flashcard toy, but a real FSRS-powered review system
- **Built for how languages actually work** — understanding sentences, not just isolated words
- **Private and simple** — no account required, no data harvested, synced through your own iCloud
- **Free** — because good tools for learning shouldn't be locked behind a paywall

So I built it.

## Get in touch

If you have feedback, a bug report, or just want to say hello:

**Email:** [hey@languageden.com](mailto:hey@languageden.com)

I read every message. I can't always respond quickly, but I genuinely appreciate hearing from people who are using the app.

*Language Den is free. It's built for language learners, by a language learner. I hope it helps.*
