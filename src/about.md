description: "Language Den is built by a solo developer who lives and breathes language learning. Learn who's behind the app and why it exists."

Language Den is a one-person project. No team. No investors. No growth hackers. Just one developer who got fed up with the existing options and decided to build something better.

## Hi, I'm Scott 👋

I'm a web and iOS developer based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, where I live with my wife and daughter. I've spent the last 15+ years building software — primarily with Ruby on Rails — with a strong bias toward tools that are productive, well-designed, and actually enjoyable to use.

I built Language Den because I'm a language learner myself, and I kept running into the same wall everyone else does: the apps that exist are either gamified to the point of uselessness, impossibly complex to set up, or just not built with real language acquisition in mind.

I wanted an app that was:

- **Serious about spaced repetition** — not a flashcard toy, but a real FSRS-powered review system
- **Built for how languages actually work** — understanding sentences, not just isolated words
- **Private and simple** — no account required, no data harvested, synced through your own iCloud
- **Free** — because good tools for learning shouldn't be locked behind a paywall

So I built it.

## Why one person?

Because it keeps things honest. There's no marketing team inflating feature promises, no growth team pushing engagement mechanics that aren't good for you. Just me, using the app myself every day, fixing what's broken and building what's actually useful.

It also means things move at a measured pace. I'd rather ship something solid than something fast.

## Get in touch

If you have feedback, a bug report, or just want to say hello:

**Email:** [hey@languageden.com](mailto:hey@languageden.com)

I read every message. I can't always respond quickly, but I genuinely appreciate hearing from people who are using the app.

*Language Den is free. It's built for language learners, by a language learner. I hope it helps.*
