<h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>

<p><strong>How do I add my first word?</strong>
Tap the <strong>+</strong> button on the Sources or Words screen to add a word manually. You can also import existing vocabulary from an Anki deck (.apkg file) or a CSV file via the Import screen.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need an account?</strong>
No account is required. Language Den uses iCloud to sync your data across devices, which is handled automatically through your existing Apple ID.</p>

<p><strong>Which languages are supported?</strong>
Language Den supports 55+ languages including Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Arabic, Thai, German, and many more. You select your target language during onboarding and can change it in Settings.</p>

<h3 id="ai-features">AI features</h3>

<p><strong>What is OpenRouter and why do I need an API key?</strong>
OpenRouter is an AI API gateway that gives Language Den access to large language models. These models power automatic flashcard generation â€” creating definitions, example sentences, and multiple card types for your words. You need to create an account at <a href="https://openrouter.ai">openrouter.ai</a> and add funds to use this feature.</p>

<p><strong>Is the AI feature required?</strong>
No. You can use Language Den fully without an API key â€” you can create flashcards manually and use all other features. The AI feature is an optional enhancement.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Unsplash API key for?</strong>
Unsplash provides access to a library of high-quality photos. With an Unsplash API key, you can search for images to attach to flashcards. You can get a free API key at <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">unsplash.com/developers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="importing">Importing</h3>

<p><strong>What Anki formats are supported?</strong>
Language Den imports .apkg files (Anki package files). Export your Anki deck as an .apkg file and use the Import option in the app.</p>

<p><strong>What CSV format does the app expect?</strong>
The app accepts CSV files with at minimum a word column and a translation column. You can map columns during the import process.</p>

<h3 id="data-and-sync">Data and sync</h3>

<p><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong>
Your data is stored on your device and synced to your personal iCloud account using CloudKit. We have no access to your data.</p>

<p><strong>How do I transfer my data to a new device?</strong>

<h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</h3>

<p><strong>What algorithm does Language Den use?</strong>
Language Den uses <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki">FSRS</a> (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler), an open-source algorithm that has been shown to outperform the older SM-2 algorithm used by traditional Anki. It adapts your review intervals based on your actual performance.</p>

<p><strong>What do the review ratings mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Again</strong> â€” you forgot the word; it will be shown again soon</li>
  <li><strong>Hard</strong> â€” you remembered, but it was difficult</li>
  <li><strong>Good</strong> â€” you remembered correctly with some effort</li>
  <li><strong>Easy</strong> â€” you remembered effortlessly; the next interval will be longer</li>
</ul>
